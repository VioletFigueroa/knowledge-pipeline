## YOUR CHOICES

### Choice 1: Use Batch Import System Now

**Timeline**: Today (3-4 hours)

```bash
cd batch-import-system/
python src/orchestrate_import.py --source-dir /path/to/lighthouse --batch-id ll-batch-1 --output-dir ./output
# 600 files processed automatically
# Ready to deploy to Logseq
```

**Result**: 600+ organized files in Logseq ✅

---

### Choice 2: Secure & Test (Recommended for Sharing)

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks (can be parallelized)

**Week 1** (8 hours):

- Initialize git
- Set up linting (Black, Flake8, Pylint)
- Set up security scanning (Bandit, Safety)
- First basic tests

**Week 2** (20 hours):

- Comprehensive unit tests (85%+ coverage)
- Integration tests
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Performance tests

**Week 3** (10 hours):

- Security policy documentation
- Contributing guidelines
- Architecture documentation
- GitHub ready

**Then** (Ongoing):

- Use code with confidence
- Refactor safely (tests catch regressions)
- Accept contributions (standards clear)
- Share publicly (meets FOSS standards)

**Result**: Production-ready, secure, testable code ✅

---

### Choice 3: Do Both (Optimal)

**Timeline**: This week + 3 weeks

```
TODAY:
1. Run batch import (3 hours) → Get 600 files into Logseq
2. Start security setup (30 min) → See first tests passing

WEEK 1-3:
3. Follow SECURITY-TESTING-QUICKSTART.md → Build full infrastructure

RESULT:
• 600+ notes in Logseq (ready to use)
• Production-ready code (ready to share)
• Comprehensive tests (ready for team)
• CI/CD pipeline (ready for scale)
```

## REALISTIC TIMELINE

```
Week 1 (Setup Phase - 8-10 hours)
├─ Mon-Tue: Git + tools (4 hrs) - MOSTLY EASY

└─ Fri: Verify + commit (1-2 hrs) - EASY

Week 2 (Testing Phase - 15-20 hours)
├─ Mon-Fri: Write unit tests (20 hrs) - MEDIUM EFFORT
│           (but mostly copy-paste pattern)
└─ Fri: Review + expand coverage - MEDIUM

Week 3 (Polish & Release - 8-10 hours)
├─ Mon-Tue: Documentation (4 hrs) - EASY
├─ Wed-Thu: GitHub setup (2 hrs) - EASY
└─ Fri: Final verification (2 hrs) - EASY
